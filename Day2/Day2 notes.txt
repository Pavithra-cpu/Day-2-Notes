Loops in Java
--------------
1.While(Entry control loop)
	is a control flow statement that allows code to be 
executed repeatedly based on the given boolean cond.
while(boolean condition)
{
//loop staements
}

2.for(Entry control loop)
intialization,condition & increement/decreemnt in same line
for(initialization condn;testing condn;increment/decrement)
{
statement(s)
}

Enhanced for loop

3.do while(Exit control loop)
similar to while lopp
it  checks for condn after executing the statements
do
{
statements..
}
while(condition);

CONSTRUCTORS
------------
block of codes similar to method
it is called when an instance of class is created 
new();
car c=new car();
string steering;
string gear;

car();
car(string steering,string gear);

1.no arg constructor
2.parametrized constructor

Constructor Overloading
----------------------
1.Consturctor can be overloaded

difference btw constructor & method
-----------------------------------

package
-------
1.built-in package
lang,awt,io,swing,util,sql etc...
2.user-defined package

three ways to access the package from outside package
1.import package.*;
2.import package.classname;
3.fully qualified name;

GUI
---
awt...
abstract window toolkit
1.flowlayout
2.broderlayout
3.gridlayout

Access MOdifiers
---------------
1.private-within a class
2.default-within a package
3.protected-within pack & outside pack
4.public-it consists of all(within/outside class,within/outside pack)

non access modifiers
--------------------
1.static
2.abstract
3.synchronized
4.volatile
5.transient
